# DCS – Digital Computer Structure Lab Series

## Module Overview & Project Objectives

The DCS (Digital Computer Structure) module provides a deep exploration of CPU architecture, memory hierarchy and management, bus arbitration, interrupts, DMA, and serial communication—culminating in hands-on experience with peripheral device programming and FPGA validation :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Across four focused lab assignments and a final capstone project, we will:

- Develop C-based firmware for microcontroller GPIO control and interrupt handling  
- Configure hardware timers and ADC/DAC modules  
- Implement DMA transfers between memory and peripherals  
- Exercise serial buses (USART, I2C, SPI) in embedded systems  
- Integrate a microprocessor core with peripherals on an FPGA as a complete MCU
