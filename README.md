# DCS – Digital Computer Structure Lab Series

## Module Objectives

In the DCS (Digital Computer Structure) module we gain a deep understanding of the modern digital computer’s organization and its peripherals, including CPU architecture, memory hierarchy, bus arbitration, interrupts, DMA and serial protocols :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. We also acquire hands-on experience programming microcontrollers in C and interfacing a variety of hardware accelerators :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Labs & Capstone Project

Based on the syllabus, the `DCS/` folder will contain four focused laboratory assignments and one final project:

1. **Lab 1: System Programming, GPIO & Interrupts**  
   Configure and program general-purpose I/O pins and implement interrupt-driven event handling in C (4 hours) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

2. **Lab 2: Hardware Timers & ADC/DAC**  
   Learn to configure timer peripherals and analog I/O modules for precise timing and data conversion (4 hours) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

3. **Lab 3: DMA Transfers**  
   Set up and validate direct-memory-access transfers between memory and peripherals without CPU intervention (4 hours) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

4. **Lab 4: Serial Communication**  
   Implement and test synchronous and asynchronous serial protocols (USART, I2C, SPI) on the microcontroller (4 hours) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

5. **Capstone Project**  
   A comprehensive embedded application combining multiple peripherals, interrupts and DMA under C control—demonstrating full mastery of module concepts (50% of grade) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
